# MASS - Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool

## Overview

The Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool is a powerful utility for identifying potential security threats during the software design phase. Using this tool, you can run the Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship Template and identify all the threats possible in a cyber-physical ship. You can also add and remove stencils to change the template according to your use case.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following:

- A computer running Windows 10 or later.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later installed on your machine.
- An internet connection to download the tool and updates.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool:

1. **Download the Tool:**
   - Visit the [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool website](https://aka.ms/threatmodelingtool) to download the latest version.

2. **Install the Tool:**
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Launch the Tool:**
   - Once installed, you can launch the tool from the Start menu or by searching for "Threat Modeling Tool".

## Setup

To set up the tool for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Tool:**
   - Launch the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool.

2. **Create a New Model:**
   - Click on `File` > `New Model` to create a new threat model.

3. **Use the Provided Template:**
   - Download and save the provided template file (`YourTemplateName.tms`). Ensure it is stored in a location you can easily access.
   - In the Threat Modeling Tool, click on `File` > `Open Template`.
   - Navigate to the location where you saved the template and open it.

4. **Save Your Model:**
   - Click on `File` > `Save As` to save your new model. Choose a name and location for your threat model file.

## Using the Template

The provided template includes predefined entities, data flows, and security properties tailored to your project. To use the template effectively:

1. **Add Components:**
   - Use the toolbox to drag and drop components such as processes, data stores, and external interactors onto the drawing surface.

2. **Define Data Flows:**
   - Connect the components by defining data flows. Use the connectors in the toolbox to draw lines between the components representing the flow of data.

3. **Configure Properties:**
   - Select each component and configure its properties in the Properties pane. This includes setting attributes like authentication, authorization, and encryption.

4. **Generate Threats:**
   - Once your diagram is complete, click on `Analyze` > `Generate Threats` to let the tool identify potential threats based on the model.

5. **Review and Mitigate Threats:**
   - Review the list of generated threats in the Threat Explorer. For each threat, you can provide mitigation strategies and document any relevant notes.

## Tips for Effective Threat Modeling

- **Iterate Regularly:** Threat modeling should be an ongoing process. Regularly update your threat model as your project evolves.
- **Collaborate:** Involve team members from different disciplines (developers, security experts, QA) to get diverse perspectives on potential threats.
- **Document Mitigations:** Clearly document how each identified threat will be mitigated. This will help in tracking the implementation of security measures.
